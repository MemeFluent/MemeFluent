A webapp to communicate through memes

-We added multiple sections including your typical
 Home and About web pages

-The main feature is the chatroom where users can
 send a meme as a message to other users
 
-The chatroom can host multiple users and will
 broadcast whether a user is currently typing
 
-The chat logs are backed up in a database at
 monogodb through dbconnect.js

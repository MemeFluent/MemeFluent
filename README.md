A webapp to communicate through memes

-We added multiple sections including your typical
 Home and About web pages

-The main feature is the chatroom where users can
 send a meme as a message to other users
 
-The chatroom can host multiple users and will
 broadcast whether a user is currently typing
 
-The chat logs are backed up in a database at
 monogodb through dbconnect.js
 
 #Features Not Implemented
 -A button in chatroom to search for desired sticker,
  gif, or meme to post. The main problem was figuring
  out how to use the Gfycat API whose documentation
  was terrible and unreadable. If we had enough time,
  then we would have chosen a different api to search
  for the appropriate meme
  
-Login feature to allow only registered users for the 
 chat. However, still some bugs and not enough time to
 fully implement.
